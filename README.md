# Node Sample Traceback Simulation
The node sample traceback is an example of the process for packet
marking using the node sample probabilistic method to traceback
the packets from an attacker to the victim.

## Note
This is a work in progress; I will be deprecating this version and rewritting from scratch in order to automate the network creation and simulation of attacker vs. victim.
